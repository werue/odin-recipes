            This pancake recipe is both gluten-free and vegan! 
            I recommend tapioca flour and xantham gum as a substitute for regular wheat flower. 
            Oat flour also works as a substitute.
            This recipe uses oatmilk, which I think turns out the best, and it's free from common allergens! 
            However, almond, soy, cashew, rice, or any other alternative milk should will do fine with this recipe.

                In a large bowl, combine the Gluten-Free Tapioca Flour, White Cane Sugar, Bakin Powder, Salt, and Xantham Gum. 
                If included, combine the Cinnamon, Nutmeg, and/or Oatmeal into the bowl.
                Mix the ingredients together with a whisk.

            <li>
                In a separate bowl, combine the Oat Milk, Apple Cider Vinegar, and Vanilla Extract. Stir the ingredients together
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the bowl full of wet ingredients into the bowl full of dry ingredients. Stir the ingredients together with a whisk.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let the bowl of batter sit for about 5 minutes. While waiting for the batter to settle, heat up a pan on medium-high heat on the stove.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the pan in 1 Tbsp of Canola Oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put half a cup of batter onto the pan. Wait until the edges of the pancake start to solidify, then flip it on its other side with a spatula.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once finished, serve the pancake onto a plate.

            <li>
                Repeat the previous 2 steps until the pancake batter is used up.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve the pancakes with Butter and Syrup.
